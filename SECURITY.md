# Security Policy

I'll cut to the chase: If you find a way to make this bot do something potentially harmful that it wasn't intended to do, and/or by people it wasn't intended to allow to do it, please do not hesitate to contact me privately so we can work to fix the issue.

Do not try to exploit any public instances. Instead, you may spin up your own instance in an isolated test environment, so you may experiment as you please.

## Ways to contact me include

- Email (m1n0rm1n3r(at)proton(dot)me)
- Discord (@m1n3r_spl)

**Do not discuss security vulnerabilities in public spaces, including GitHub issues.**

## PGP Key

When reporting a vulnerability, please encrypt any potentially sensitive information with the following PGP key:
